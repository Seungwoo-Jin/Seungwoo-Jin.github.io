     **Wheelchair controlled by arm motion**
     
     This work was invented to control the wheelchair by arm motion (e.g., go straight, turn left, and turn right). Kinect (XBOX 360, Microsoft) was used to recognize the arm motion. I developed a software system for Kinect based on the C language.
