     **Systems for rodent virtual reality experiment**
     
     This system is invented to precisely control visual stimuli for understanding how the hippocampus process visuospatial information to fire in location-selective firing (i.e., place cell). I developed this customized virtual reality system from scratch in hardware and software systems

     **Systems for online sharp-wave ripple detection, analysis and disruption**
     
     This system is devised for understanding the functional significance of sharp-wave ripple in the hippocampus. This system can analyze SWR profiles in real-time (e.g., number and frequency of SWR), monitor animal behavior, and disrupt SWR by electrical stimulation

     **Systems for intracranial self-stimulation**
     
     This system is designed for replacing natural rewards (e.g., sugar-coated cereal) with stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus. I developed a customized conditioning chamber, surgical technique, customized stimulation-controlled system. I currently apply it to spatial memory tasks in T-maze or virtual reality environments.

     **Systems for radial arm maze with automated door**
     
     This system is designed to automatically open or close the door in the eight-arm maze for spatial memory tasks
