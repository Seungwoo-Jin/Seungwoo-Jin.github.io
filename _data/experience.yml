    *'Why do most experiences fade away and some emotionally arousing events are remembered for a lifetime?'*
    
    Emotion profoundly influences cognitive processing, including learning and memory. This emotional memory is my favorite research topic, 
    and I would like to reveal the neural mechanisms of how emotionally arousing events lasts for the lifetime in our memory and how negative emotions (e.g., fear and anxiety) 
    interfere the learning and memory processing. 
    To this end, I would like to develop an appropriate behavioral paradigm and apply up-to-date research techniques such as electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics.
    
    I will be happy if the way of erasing the painful memories will be developed in the future.
