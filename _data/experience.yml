    *'Why do most experiences fade away and some emotionally arousing events are remembered for a lifetime?'*
    
    Emotion profoundly influences cognitive processing, including learning and memory. This emotional memory is my favorite research topic, 
    and I would like to reveal the neural mechanisms of emotional memory by studying the interaction between hippocampal and cortical/subcortical networks. 
    To this end, I would like to develop an appropriate behavioral paradigm (e.g., remembering places associated with different values) and 
    elucidate the mechanism by using various research techniques such as electrophysiology, imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics.
